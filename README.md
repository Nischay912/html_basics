# HTML Basics - Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and examples for learning HTML (HyperText Markup Language), the standard markup language for creating web pages.

## Introduction to HTML
HTML provides the structure of a webpage. It consists of a series of elements that you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.

## Basic Structure
Every HTML document follows a basic structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
